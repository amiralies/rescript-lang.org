As we're entering a new chapter for ReScript, I keep hearing a question: What comes next? And this question has a simple answer: we'll keep growing. There's still a lot to create around the ReScript language.

Here’s what the team is up to…

## Compiler, Docs and IDE integration

Hongbo is tuning the compiler and build system for absurd scale and performance. Patrick is [reimagining the React documentation](https://github.com/reason-association/rescript-lang.org/pull/96), while building a solid baseline vim plugin. Cristiano and Cheng are rethinking the ReScript experience inside your favourite editor. Autocompletion, jump to definition and type hints are implemented:

Stay tuned, open beta for our new language server is coming soon! Vim included!

## Syntax

As for the syntax side, ReScript users have requested a roadmap for a long time. In an effort to increase transparency about our goals with the syntax, I’ll be sharing some thoughts on the road ahead for ReScript’s syntax.

A lot of what we put into the syntax derives directly from the needs and aspirations of our developers building products with ReScript. We definitely do have some ideas of our own, but at the core of our philosophy is that our users need to ship fantastic products. If there's anything  we can do to make life easier for our developers without unnecessarily bloating the language, we'll do it. 

Whether it’s [planning healthy meals](https://leiwand-kochen.at), [doing online teaching](https://www.pupilfirst.com) or [helping families spend more quality time together](https://familyfive.app/), our main goal is to empower developers to achieve success.

### Custom Operators

Encouraged by that goal, we’ve asked developers from different companies about their needs and pain-points. The most requested feature was custom operators, otherwise they wouldn't be able to upgrade to the new ReScript syntax. As a team we need to carefully judge each feature we implement. What's its value, and whether it’s worth the cost. Throughout that process, specific design questions came up:
- Can we provide good error messages?
- Will this lead to complex and slow code?
- Should we only support a subset of overridable operators (like +, -, /, *, ...)?
- Would it be possible to postpone the decision a little bit longer?
- Will this feature be abused?

As you can imagine, making such a fundamental feature decision may make or break a language. After several team meetings, we finally decided that the benefits outweigh the downsides. Even though a lot of problem solving is required to make this feature _feel nice_, it will be part of the ReScript language in the near future.

We think custom operators are super helpful when used in the mathematical context, e.g. `Vector.add(vector1, vector2)` could be expressed as `vector1 + vector2`. We don't think they should be used for implementing your own mini language though (like `>>|` or `a >>= b`). We need to be aware that our coworkers need to read and understand the code we write, and we trust our users to not abuse this feature.

### Simpler Interop

Aside from the compiler and editor integration, there are other areas in which we can innovate and provide significant value for developers. It’s very important for the team to make shipping apps in a modern JS stack more intuitive. That’s why we’re exploring new ways to import and export values from JavaScript. Regardless of what the outcome might be, this is very high on our list to explore. Writing bindings will never disappear, but we can make it more enjoyable.

### React 17

Last but not least, there are some updates to JSX coming. 

> Although React 17 doesn't ship with any new features, there is [a new JSX transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html). The new JSX improves bundle size, reduces the number of concepts you need to learn in React and improves the performance. 

It speaks for itself that this will be a part of ReScript, and we will make sure that our users will have a smooth transition phase without any breaking changes.

Fasten your seatbelt, all that good stuff is going to give you a head start and more time to focus on actually shipping your product.

Stay safe!
